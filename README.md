## install
```shell script
make init_dev
```

## Test
if you have `pyenv` environment or have installed multi python version, you can
use `tox` with multi versions of python.
you need to set version numbers to use in `.python-version` if you use `pyenv`.

```shell script
3.8.2
3.7.7
```

(this is not required if you don't use pyenv and can access to both of 
`python3.8` and `python3.7` from project root.)
